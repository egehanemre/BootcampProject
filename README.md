## Brief Game Description

<GameName> is a Roguelike, Turn-Based Card game. The game’s core gameplay revolves around
strategically managing a limited number of cards with different effects in your deck to defeat enemies in complex, turn-based
battles and progress through map. As players progress, they can achieve different cards through combat and item drops to alter the gameplay loop for each run and future runs by unlocking new
cards and weapons that permanently appear in subsequent runs to provide replayability.

# Detailed Description
<GameName> is a Roguelike, Turn-Based Card game that places players in a challenging and
strategic enviroment where every decision can mean the difference between victory and defeat. The gameplay
is centered around a unique bullet system integrated with card mechanics, creating complex, turn-based
battles that require thoughtful planning and adaptability.
### Gameplay Overview
In <GameName>, each card in your deck represents a specific action or bullet type which you must use
strategically to create chain combos and advance through levels. Players start with a basic deck, but as they progress, they can
acquire new cards through combat and item drops and also unlock permanent unlocks for the next
playthroughs. This deck-building mechanic allows for extensive customization, enabling players to
develop unique strategies tailored to their playstyle.
### Turn-Based Combat
Our approach for combat in <GameName> is turn-based, with a focus on anticipating and countering enemy actions. Each
card played adds a bullet to your magazine, which is fired at the end of your turn. Observing the bullets
in enemy magazines is crucial, as it allows you to place your own bullets strategically to counter
their moves effectively. This layer of strategy distinguishes <GameName> from traditional card games,
adding depth and complexity to each encounter.
### Deck-Building Mechanics
One of the standout features of <GameName> is it's approach to deck-building mechanics, we introduce different card types such as attack/counter/buff cards. Players start with a
basic deck but can customize and enhance it by acquiring new cards through gameplay leading to insane chain combos if used right. This system not
only allows for significant player choice and strategic depth but also includes a permanent unlock
system. This means that new cards and weapons unlocked during runs will appear in future
playthroughs, providing ongoing opportunities for evolving strategies and ensuring that each game
session feels fresh and engaging.
